# Introduction

   This is an attempt to predict Stock prices based on Stock prices of previous days. [The stock market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp) refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place. 
   
  This is a time series analysis and we will see simple eight ways to predict the Stock prices. The various models to be used are:
   1. Average
   2. Weighted Average
   3. Moving Average
   4. Moving Weighted Average
   5. Linear Regression
   6. Weighted Linear Regression

We have to either drop the data or adjust the values before split. Since the split is 2 for 1, we can normalize the data prior to split by dividing them by 2. (Old shares are half that of today's share).
